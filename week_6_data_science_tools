### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

* '+ (binary)	a + b	Addition	Sum of a and b

* '- (unary)	-a	Unary Negation	Value equal to a but opposite in sign

* '- (binary)	a - b	Subtraction	b subtracted from a

* ' *	a * b	Multiplication	Product of a and b

* /	a / b	Division	Quotient when a is divided by b


```python
## This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
